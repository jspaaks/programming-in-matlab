%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INITIALIZATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Define initial states of variables (water heights)

%Start a record of water heights

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CALCULATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
while (hUp - hLo) > Criterion 
     
    % calculate water volumes with 'calcvol.m' for hMid
	
    % implement bisection method using if-else-end structure
    
    % concatenate the record of water heights with the current hL, hMid and hU
    
    % visualize the height record

    % force MATLAB to make a figure before continuing:
    drawnow
	
end %while

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OUTPUT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Assign final approximated value of hMid to output variable WaterHeight
